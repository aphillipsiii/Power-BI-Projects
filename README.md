#[Project 1: Patient Appointment Analysis](https://github.com/aphillipsiii/Power-BI-Projects/patient_appointment_analysis_proj)  

**Overview**  

Patient No-Shows permeate medical practices, across specialties, locations, and practice models. No-shows
consistently cause problems for medical practices. Therefore, medical practices track their No-Show rates to
realize the impact that No-Shows have on both their internal processes and bottom-line revenue.  

There are many reasons why patients fail to make their appointments. However, there are demographic
similarities across patients who no-show more consistently than others. This project analyzes medical
appointments for a seven-month period (November 2015 – June 2016). Over 110,000 appointments are
included in the underlying dataset. Factors under considerations include age, gender, alcoholism, diabetes,
handicap, hypertension, patient’s location, scheduled appointment time, and whether the patient received an
automated SMS appointment reminder.  

**Key Objectives**  
1. Identify factors that are shared among patients who routinely no-show for appointments
  2. Determine the most important factor that contributes to whether a patient is a no-show for their scheduled appointment
  3. Provide suggestions to minimize the number of No-Shows
